## Let's play Trabble!

Scrabble is a popular two-to-four player word game. 
This is a program to implement a two-player version of Scrabble with GUI in Python.

I call it Trabble (t[wo-sc]rabble).


Part of the codes come from my solution to Problem Sets 5-6 in the MIT600 (2008 fall) course. I like to elaborate on the original program and add GUI to this word game, though I myself am extremely bad at Scrabble.
 

#### Rules of  Trabble:

Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.


#### Modes of Playing:

- Human player(s) VS 1 Computer player

- 2 Human players

(2 computer players would be boring so I left that out.)
